# Socialist Personality

## What

This service helps you collect and consider your social connections. It provides suggestions as to how you may find peace.

## Why

Personality scores are overabundant and often wrong. This service is meant to replace systems like MBTI, Big Five, and ennegrams.

In Capitalism we are told that personality is an expression of our activities. (eg I like to paint)

I argue personality is an expression of our social relationships. (eg I feel connected to a community of painters) 

So when we are constantly trying to figure out who we are under the capitalist construct, it always ends up feeling hollow, because activities are small and unfulfilling for our attachment needs. But when I consider the groups I’m a part of like dancing, football, and college radio, it describes my activities as extensions of attachments. 

The other aspect is how we feel/perform in the relationships. Capitalism would have us believe our feelings are our fault, but really they are expressions of our environments. So the complete personality picture is something like, “groups/relationships you’re a part of now and groups/relationships you used to be in, scored by how frequently you interact with them and the emotional quality of the interactions.”
