# Socialist Personality Score

## What

This is a tool to help you evaluate yourself, through the lens of social connections. It is a tool to help you grow.

This is not a test that reduces you to a four letter code or a zodiac sign or a "spirit animal" who can only be friends with specific "personality types".

Instead, the tool takes the data you provide, and helps you make more informed decisions about how and with whom to spend your time with (including yourself). It is meant to empower you to lead a more fulfilling life in modern society.

If you have never seriously taken stock of your relationships, this tool will help you start to ask questions. If you have already thought about these things before, the tool will help you make more precise choices about how you spend your time.

## Why

In Capitalism we are told that personality is an expression of our activities. (eg I like to paint)

I argue personality is an expression of our social relationships. (eg I feel connected to a community of painters) 

So when we are constantly trying to figure out who we are under the capitalist construct, it always ends up feeling hollow, because activities are small and unfulfilling for our attachment needs. But when I consider the groups I’m a part of like dancing, football, and college radio, it describes my activities as extensions of social attachments. 

The other aspect is how we feel/perform in the relationships. Capitalism would have us believe our feelings are our fault, but really they are expressions of our environments. So the complete personality picture is something like, “groups/relationships you’re a part of now and groups/relationships you used to be in, scored by how frequently you interact with them and the emotional quality of the interactions.”

Many CPTSD survivors report that once they have reached the stage of basic safety and boundaries, there is a hollowness that comes from not understanding how to form healthy attachments and re-integrate with society. This tool is designed with that community in mind, although anyone can benefit from using this.

MBTI, Big Five, and Ennegrams are more useful for reducing you to a code or number, so decisions can be made *about* you, than actually empowering you to lead a more fulfilling life.

I have attempted to make this tool as judgment-free as possible. There is no one right way to live a fulfilling life. Although I believe humans are all far more alike than capitalism tries to tell us, we do inevitably have physical, cognitive, and environmental differences.

## How to use it

If this is your first time using the SPS, don't try to capture everything in one sitting. Just capture a few of your current groups to start with. Even if you have a lot of spare time right now, it's better to do this over a longer time span, so your mind can wander and add things as it feels inspired to. 

Once you have built up a collection you are happy with, I recommend creating a habit of updating and reviewing your SPS every 3 months. So you can update your enjoyment, vulnerability, dates, group sizes etc.

It is expected that groups will have periodic stops and starts, especially due to covid19. You should only change the "end/stop" date, whenever you leave a group or it is put on hold. When you re-enter the group, just change the "end/stop" date back to "ongoing".

## What kinds of questions can be answered by this tool?

- Am I investing in the balance of types of social activities that feels good to me? Am I putting all of my eggs in one basket?
- Do I have relationships where I feel accepted and can experiment/make mistakes?
- Am I happy with the range of group sizes I'm a part of? Am I in too many large communities and needing more personal affection? Am I limited only to close relationships and needing a sense of belonging to a community?
- Am I allotting the right amount of time to fulfilling relationships and minimizing exposure to less healthy relationships?
- Am I learning from past experiences and joining healthier groups, or has my situation been trending towards lack of safety?
- Am I spending tons of time with one person in all of my social groups? 

## Terminology
### Understanding Dual Relationships

This is a borrowed and repurposed term from psychotherapy. A dual relationship is when you interact with a single person in more than one social environment. A dual relationship can reduce the diversity of ideas/activities/people you are exposed to in both environments. Dual relationships can be really helpful for providing us security, especially when joining huge communities. 

However, the potential downside is that dual relationships can result in reduction of boundaries, thus weakening your sense of security and self. If your dual relationship with a person turns sour, and you need to abandon them for your safety, you may lose several social environments rather than just one.

Examples of a dual relationships might be:

- your friend goes swing dancing with you, and is also in your board games group.
- your father is the coach of your football team, takes you to church every sunday, and drives you to your friends' houses
