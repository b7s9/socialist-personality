            <h1 id="socialist-personality-score">Socialist Personality Score</h1>
            <a href="./form.html">See the questionnaire</a>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>I want to...</p>
<ol>
<li>Teach the world that your personality is an extension of who you spend time with now, and who you grew up with. <em>Environments shape us.</em></li>
<li>Help trauma victims (ie. myself) build and maintain social support networks for overall well-being.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<p>The Socialist Personality Score is more of a system of self-evaluation and self-improvement than a mainstream &quot;personality test&quot;. This is not a test that reduces you to a four letter code or a zodiac sign or a &quot;spirit animal&quot; who can only be friends with specific &quot;personality types&quot;. </p>
<p>Instead, the system takes the data you provide, and helps you make more informed decisions about how and with whom to spend your time with (including yourself). It is meant to empower you to lead a more fulfilling life in modern society.</p>
<p>If you have never seriously taken stock of your relationships, this tool will help you start to ask questions. If you have already thought about these things before, the ideas will help you make more precise choices about how you spend your time.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>In Capitalism we are told that personality is an expression of our activities. (eg I like to paint)</p>
<p>A more helpful definition is that personality is an expression of our social relationships. (eg I feel connected to a community of painters)</p>
<p>So, when we are constantly trying to figure out who we are under the capitalist construct, it always ends up feeling hollow, because <em>activities</em> are small and unfulfilling for our attachment needs. But when I consider the <em>social groups</em> I’m a part of like dancing, football, and college radio, it describes my activities as extensions of social attachments</p>
<h2 id="the-5-social-groups">The 5 Social Groups</h2>
<p>I am drafting a system of 5 types of social groups, which satisfy maintenance of all-around health. </p>
<ul>
<li>Groups can be any size. Having access to a wide range of group sizes—from individual relationship to large community—is a good way to find balance.</li>
<li>You can have more than one group in a single category. The theory is you will find more balance in health by maintaining relationships in all five.</li>
<li>At least one group should involve regular physical exercise, if it is not already required by your daily routine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-individual-craft">1. Individual Craft</h3>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>Painting</li>
<li>Graffiti</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Writing/Poetry</li>
<li>Magic tricks and solo performance arts</li>
<li>Video Essays/Podcasts</li>
<li>Origami</li>
<li>Gardening</li>
<li>Woodworking</li>
<li>Metalworking</li>
<li>Model trains</li>
<li>Social Media &quot;Content&quot;</li>
<li>Most forms of &quot;Tinkering&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
<p>Individual craft is about taking influence from culture, then building, modifying, synthesizing, copying, and expressing culture using a given medium. You make/record an object/performance, then it is shared with a broader community (often) asynchronously as a means of social interaction. </p>
<p>Essentially &quot;parallel play&quot;, rather than playing directly with peers as in Collective Craft.</p>
<p>A group dedicated to individual craft might be an online forum, an evening class, a meetup, or other way of gathering inspiration, sharing struggles, and receiving feedback. As the title suggests, the bulk of the &quot;work&quot; may be done alone, but the input and/or output of your work should foster curiosity and/or vulnerability.</p>
<p>The opportunity with individual craft is to hone a creative skill, giving you access to richer means of describing/capturing your environment and communicating with peers.</p>
<h4 id="healing-skills">Healing skills</h4>
<ul>
<li>Curiosity</li>
<li>Vulnerability</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Proficiency</li>
<li>Introversion/Self-reliance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-collective-craft">2. Collective Craft</h3>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>Social Dance (eg. Swing, Square, Blues)</li>
<li>Music (live band)</li>
<li>Live theater/Improvisation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
<p>(examples imply &quot;...with a live group&quot;. )</p>
<p>Thus far this is my favorite group type, because I fear it the most. Collective Craft is about <em>synchronous</em> cultural and social exchange. Rather than splitting inspiration and output into separate actions, Collective Craft forces you to stay on your toes and respond to your peers in realtime. </p>
<p>A group dedicated to collective craft might be a local improv group, local dance class, a Rock band, or a local chorus. </p>
<p>You will have less place to hide mistakes than Individual Craft, so the opportunity is to hone your resilience and vulnerability so you can more easily go with the flow. </p>
<h4 id="healing-skills">Healing Skills</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerability</li>
<li>Proficiency</li>
<li>Extraversion/Positivity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-games-sports-competition-and-skills">3. Games, Sports, Competition, and Skills</h3>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>Individual and team sports (eg. Football, Basketball, Tennis, Distance Running)</li>
<li>Extreme sports (eg. skiing, skateboarding)</li>
<li>Board and Card games (eg. Chess, Hearts)</li>
<li>&quot;Social&quot; Games (eg. Trivia, streaming-friendly games)</li>
<li>Martial Arts</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
<p>I need a more succinct name for this one... Maybe something like &quot;Rule-based Competition and Skills&quot;. I&#39;m sure the researchers have something I can borrow from here.</p>
<p>Note: I purposely don&#39;t include solitaire games here because I think they tend to be more along the lines of simple dissociation exercises rather than crafts/skills/games with broader social or cultural interaction. </p>
<p>A group dedicated to games and sports might be a local soccer league, a snow sports club, a chess club, a tai chi class.</p>
<p>The opportunity here is to release deeper needs of anger and conquest. Developing skills to fight against your peers/the environment in a controlled way, will prevent anger/restlessness from seeping into other areas of your life. </p>
<h4 id="healing-skills">Healing Skills</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>Proficiency</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-collective-organization">4. Collective Organization</h3>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>Labor, capitalist income source</li>
<li>Volunteering</li>
<li>Activism</li>
<li>Politics</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
<p>Collective Organization is how you can work together with your peers towards a shared goal/action, and make a greater impact on the world than you could as an individual. </p>
<p>A group dedicated to collective organization might be your city&#39;s bicycle coalition, a TV/film workers&#39; union, free/open source project, a food distribution site, after-school program, or your professional workplace.</p>
<p>The opportunity to impact society can help provide you with a feeling of empowerment. (I&#39;m missing something here...)</p>
<h4 id="healing-skills">Healing Skills</h4>

<h3 id="5-affinity-groups">5. Affinity Groups</h3>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>Friends</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>social media and discussion forums</li>
<li>Book Clubs</li>
<li>Issue-specific support groups (eg. LGBTQ, BIPOC, PTSD, addiction)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
<p>Affinity Groups are the catch all for any relationship which is not organized around a specific goal or activity. These are the most accessible relationships, since they generally require no startup cost, but they are most the difficult to maintain because there is no provided activity/goal to sustain them—you&#39;ll have to self-motivate to create the infrastructure for maintenance, if your environment doesn&#39;t already provide it.</p>
<p>The opportunity with Affinity groups is to find <em>your people</em>. Here you can find common ground based on environmental situations. These can lead to feeling accepted/safe/supported.</p>
<h4 id="healing-skills">Healing skills</h4>
<ul>
<li>Empathy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evaluation-measures">Evaluation Measures</h2>
<p>The following is a method of evaluating each of our groups.</p>
<p>If this is your first time using the SPS, don&#39;t try to capture everything in one sitting. Just capture a few of your current groups to start with. Even if you have a lot of spare time right now, it&#39;s better to do this over a longer time span, so your mind can wander and add things as it feels inspired to.</p>
<p>Once you have built up a collection you are happy with, I recommend creating a habit of updating and reviewing your SPS every 3 months. The nature of your relationships will change over time. Hopefully this tool helps you find agency in the process.</p>
<p>Note: Group/Relationship are used interchangeably. </p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is the name of this relationship? (e.g. rock band, book club, romantic partner)</li>
<li>How often do you interact with this group?<ul>
<li>Several times per day</li>
<li>Almost every day</li>
<li>Once or twice per week</li>
<li>Once or twice per month</li>
<li>Once or twice per year</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the primary category of this group?<ul>
<li>Individual Craft</li>
<li>Collective Craft</li>
<li>Games/Skills/Competition</li>
<li>Collective Organization</li>
<li>Affinity Groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How many people are in this group? (including you)</li>
<li>Does this group contain a dual relationship? (yes/no)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not expected that all of your groups will satisfy all three of the below measures. These measures are a guide to help you understand which of your relationships are helping you, hurting you, or are neutral.</p>
<p>If it helps, for all of the following evaluative questions, append in your head &quot;...without fear of punishment&quot;</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself and go with your gut.</p>
<h3 id="enjoyment">Enjoyment</h3>
<p>&quot;Do I look forward to spending time with this group?&quot; </p>
<ul>
<li>Definitely Yes</li>
<li>Probably Yes</li>
<li>I&#39;m not Sure</li>
<li>Probably Not</li>
<li>Definitely Not
(5 point likert scale)</li>
</ul>
<p>There will inevitably be some relationships you don&#39;t enjoy (eg. for most folks that&#39;s a 9-5 job), but generally you should seek to have mostly enjoyable relationships.</p>
<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>
<p>&quot;Can I express my thoughts and feelings?&quot; (5 point likert, Yes:No)</p>
<p>Not every group needs to give you an opportunity for emotional vulnerability, but these relationships are places where you can feel seen and supported.</p>
<h3 id="growth">Growth</h3>
<p>&quot;Am I encouraged to make or learn from mistakes?&quot; (5 point likert, Yes:No)</p>
<p>This measure will probably be the least frequent in your groups as it is the most elusive, but finding the security to grow is ultimately how you will heal from trauma.</p>
<h2 id="terminology-and-additional-thoughts">Terminology and Additional Thoughts</h2>
<h3 id="dual-relationships">Dual Relationships</h3>
<p>This is a borrowed and repurposed term from psychotherapy. A dual relationship is when you interact with a single person in more than one social environment. A dual relationship can reduce the diversity of ideas/activities/people you are exposed to in both environments. Dual relationships can be really helpful for providing us safety initially, especially when joining communities. </p>
<p>However, the potential downside is that dual relationships can result in reduction of boundaries, thus weakening your sense of security and self. If your dual relationship with a person turns sour, and you need to abandon them for your safety, <strong>you may have to abandon several social groups rather than just one.</strong></p>
<p>Examples of a dual relationships might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>your friend goes swing dancing with you, and is also in your board games group.</li>
<li>your father is the coach of your football team, takes you to church every sunday, and drives you to your friends&#39; houses</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="questions-for-initial-research">Questions for Initial Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where do &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; and other roleplay games fit into the 5 groups model?</li>
<li>More ideas about collective action</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li>[x] First draft and ideation</li>
<li>[ ] Research/Testing, refining goals</li>
<li>[ ] Create second draft based on research</li>
<li>[ ] Create visual and shareable versions of these ideas</li>
<li>[ ] Create local web app to manage and review growth data</li>
<li>[ ] Create centralized web app to manage and review growth data</li>
</ul>
