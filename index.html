            <h2 id="what">What</h2>
            <p>This is a tool to help you evaluate yourself, through the lens of social connections. It is a tool to
                help
                you grow.</p>
            <p>This is not a test that reduces you to a four letter code or a zodiac sign or a &quot;spirit animal&quot;
                who
                can only be friends with specific &quot;personality types&quot;.</p>
            <p>Instead, the tool takes the data you provide, and helps you make more informed decisions about how and
                with
                whom to spend your time with (including yourself). It is meant to empower you to lead a more fulfilling
                life
                in modern society.</p>
            <p>If you have never seriously taken stock of your relationships, this tool will help you start to ask
                questions. If you have already thought about these things before, the tool will help you make more
                precise
                choices about how you spend your time.</p>

            <h2 id="why">Why</h2>
            <p>In Capitalism we are told that personality is an expression of our activities. (eg I like to paint)</p>
            <p>I argue personality is an expression of our social relationships. (eg I feel connected to a community of
                painters) </p>
            <p>So when we are constantly trying to figure out who we are under the capitalist construct, it always ends
                up
                feeling hollow, because activities are small and unfulfilling for our attachment needs. But when I
                consider
                the groups I’m a part of like dancing, football, and college radio, it describes my activities as
                extensions
                of social attachments. </p>
            <p>The other aspect is how we feel/perform in the relationships. Capitalism would have us believe our
                feelings
                are our fault, but really they are expressions of our environments. So the complete personality picture
                is
                something like, “groups/relationships you’re a part of now and groups/relationships you used to be in,
                scored by how frequently you interact with them and the emotional quality of the interactions.”</p>
            <p>Many CPTSD survivors report that once they have reached the stage of basic safety and boundaries, there
                is a
                hollowness that comes from not understanding how to form healthy attachments and re-integrate with
                society.
                This tool is designed with that community in mind, although anyone can benefit from using this.</p>
            <p>MBTI, Big Five, and Ennegrams are more useful for reducing you to a code or number, so decisions can be
                made
                <em>about</em> you, than actually empowering you to lead a more fulfilling life.</p>
            <p>I have attempted to make this tool as judgment-free as possible. There is no one right way to live a
                fulfilling life. Although I believe humans are all far more alike than capitalism tries to tell us, we
                do
                inevitably have physical, cognitive, and environmental differences.</p>

            <h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h2>
            <p>If this is your first time using the SPS, don&#39;t try to capture everything in one sitting. Just
                capture a
                few of your current groups to start with. Even if you have a lot of spare time right now, it&#39;s
                better to
                do this over a longer time span, so your mind can wander and add things as it feels inspired to. </p>
            <p>Once you have built up a collection you are happy with, I recommend creating a habit of updating and
                reviewing your SPS every 3 months. So you can update your enjoyment, vulnerability, dates, group sizes
                etc.
            </p>
            <p>It is expected that groups will have periodic stops and starts, especially due to covid19. You should
                only
                change the &quot;end/stop&quot; date, whenever you leave a group or it is put on hold. When you re-enter
                the
                group, just change the &quot;end/stop&quot; date back to &quot;ongoing&quot;.</p>

                this
                tool?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Am I investing in the balance of types of social activities that feels good to me? Am I putting all
                    of
                    my eggs in one basket?</li>
                <li>Do I have relationships where I feel accepted and can experiment/make mistakes?</li>
                <li>Am I happy with the range of group sizes I&#39;m a part of? Am I in too many large communities and
                    needing more personal affection? Am I limited only to close relationships and needing a sense of
                    belonging to a community?</li>
                <li>Am I allotting the right amount of time to fulfilling relationships and minimizing exposure to less
                    healthy relationships?</li>
                <li>Am I learning from past experiences and joining healthier groups, or has my situation been trending
                    towards lack of safety?</li>
                <li>Am I spending tons of time with one person in all of my social groups? </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
            <h3 id="understanding-dual-relationships">Understanding Dual Relationships</h3>
            <p>This is a borrowed and repurposed term from psychotherapy. A dual relationship is when you interact with
                a
                single person in more than one social environment. A dual relationship can reduce the diversity of
                ideas/activities/people you are exposed to in both environments. Dual relationships can be really
                helpful
                for providing us security, especially when joining huge communities. </p>
            <p>However, the potential downside is that dual relationships can result in reduction of boundaries, thus
                weakening your sense of security and self. If your dual relationship with a person turns sour, and you
                need
                to abandon them for your safety, you may lose several social environments rather than just one.</p>
            <p>Examples of a dual relationships might be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your friend goes swing dancing with you, and is also in your board games group.</li>
                <li>your father is the coach of your football team, takes you to church every sunday, and drives you to
                    your
                    friends&#39; houses</li>
            </ul>
